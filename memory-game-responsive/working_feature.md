As I attempted to use chat gpt for this, I realized it was not going to get me far. Therefore, I started playing with the setting myself to see if I could get it closer and then use chat from there. Within the 'grid' function, I set the width to 60% to prevent the cards from being stretched way past the display. Then, I made my way up to "game_container" and set the 'top' value to 40%. These seemed to get the grid into a smaller layout that is within the white container.This in addition to setting the 'position' at fixed instead of absolute. At first the container starts way above,but as soon as we click start it goes back to its intended position. Upon restarts the grid no longer shifts.
